# Map Styles 

Map Styles is a powerful and easy-to-use add-on for Concrete CMS that gives editors full control over the visual appearance of all Google Maps embedded on a page — including those inserted via core blocks, third-party add-ons, or custom HTML code using the Maps JavaScript API.
Whether you're building for light or dark themes, this add-on lets you apply a custom JSON style to all Google Maps instances without touching the original block settings.

The add-on works by dynamically detecting and styling every map on the page at runtime — even when multiple maps are used across different containers. Ideal for agencies or projects where consistent branding and a seamless design experience are essential.

You can manage styles directly from the page settings or set a global fallback style across your site. No coding required — just copy and paste your style JSON and you’re done.
